# BirthdayGraph
Two bits of code.

Linear.c
Rotate.c

Linear.c creates a spiralling video that is a minute long. It needs command line parameters that relate to its earlier incarnation as a birthday grapher.
Rotate.c calculates the numner of years old you need to be to have all the lines on your chart.

These are just for interest and creation of art and fun and not serious commercial codes so please dont bite me.

If you watch this... some of this might make sense
